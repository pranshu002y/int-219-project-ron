      <h2 class="blog-head">Latest Google Pixel Tensor Chip</h2>
      <p>
        With the Pixel 6, we finally got hands-on with Google’s first bespoke
        mobile system on a chip (SoC), dubbed Google Tensor. While the company
        has dabbled with add-on hardware in the past, like the Pixel Visual Core
        and Titan M security chip, the Google Tensor chip represents the
        company’s first attempt at designing a custom mobile SoC. Or at least
        part-designing. Even though Google hasn’t developed every component from
        scratch, the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) is all in-house, and it’s at
        the heart of what the company wants to accomplish with the SoC. As
        expected, Google has stated that the processor is laser-focused on
        enhanced imaging and machine learning (ML) capabilities. To that end,
        Tensor doesn’t deliver ground-breaking raw power in most applications,
        but that’s because the company is targeting other use-cases instead.
        Given this nuanced approach to chip design then, it’s worth taking a
        closer look at the guts of Google’s new SoC and what the company hopes
        to accomplish with it in the future. Here’s everything you need to know
        about Google Tensor.
        <br />
        First and foremost, Tensor is a custom piece of silicon designed by
        Google to be efficient at the things the company most wants to
        prioritize, such as machine learning-related workloads. Needless to say,
        Tensor is a significant step up from the chips Google used in the
        previous-generation mid-range Pixel 5. In fact, it rubs shoulders with
        flagship SoCs from the likes of Qualcomm and Samsung. That’s no
        coincidence, though — we know that Google collaborated with Samsung to
        co-develop and fabricate the Tensor SoC. And without delving too deep
        into the specifications, it’s also worth noting that the chip shares
        many of the Exynos 2100’s underpinnings, from components like the GPU
        and modem to architectural aspects like clock and power management.
